+ add menu command to show up foo_title (which can be particulary useful when it's not always on top or it disappeared mysteriously)
  + add support for adding menu commands to foo_managedWrapper
  + test unicode in menu items = they don't work
  + when foo_title is disabled via the menu command, it doesn't show up in the prefpage
- prevent layers from drawing outside their clientRect, that could be probably done with Drawing.Clip or ClipRegion
 - click through

 - add support for more actions for buttons, such as commands from the context menu
 + scriptable values
 - show only for a while (like pretty popup)
 - option to set actions for click/doubleclick/rightclick
 - reset options button
 - maybe create the effect of reflecting glass ;)
 - extendable panels :)
 - BUG: closing the display window with Alt-F4 makes it crash
- cleaning the code
 - divide the Main class into several smaller classes for easier mantaince
     - one class that is the plugin itself - that receives events from foobar
                                           - that creates services such as menu commands
     - other classes for ..
     - move properties to one block, protected fields to one block, methods to one block,...
